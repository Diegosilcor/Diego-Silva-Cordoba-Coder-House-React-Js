## E-COMMERCE

### The project deals with the simulation of an e-commerce for the sale of clothing with sports and informal characteristics

## BROWSING

*The different routes that exist so far consist of:

*A directory '/' that shows the home of the page, where you can see the list of all the products (ItemListContainer)

*A 'category/id' directory that displays the results of filtering the item list into three different categories (same ItemListContainer component reused)

*A 'detail/id' directory which can be accessed by pressing the "view detail" button on the cards. This action shows us the ItemDetailContainer component, where you can see the detail of any of the chosen cards.
